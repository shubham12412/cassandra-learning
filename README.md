Cassandra was open-sourced by Facebook in July 2008. This original version of Cassandra was written primarily by an ex-employee from Amazon and one from Microsoft. It was strongly influenced by Dynamo, Amazon’s pioneering distributed key/value database. Cassandra implements a Dynamo-style replication model with no single point of failure, but adds a more powerful “column family” data model.


Its popularity is due in large part to the outstanding technical features it provides. It is durable, seamlessly scalable, and tuneably consistent. It performs blazingly fast writes, can store hundreds of terabytes of data, and is decentralized and symmetrical so there’s no single point of failure. It is highly available and offers a data model based on the Cassandra Query Language (CQL).
